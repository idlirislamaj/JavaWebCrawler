# JavaWebCrawler
Web Crawler build in Java

I built this small app using Maven. What it does is written below:

1. Query on google for a given string and returns the result as you expect it on your browser
2. It takes all the links retrived from the query and stores them in a HashSet
3. Than it finds JS libraries on every single link and returns the frequency in the console


There is a lot room for improvement. So feel free to suggest
